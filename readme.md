# Digifridge
[Live Demo](https://digifridge.herokuapp.com/#/) - 
Digifridge is a digital representation of your fridge and a dynamic recipe recommender. Users make an account and enter the foods they have in stock. A user can select the foods from their fridge they’d look to use, and we’ll return recipes using those foods from the Edamam API (https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api)


## Functionality and MVP
### 1. Frontend and backend user authentication
+ Users can sign up and immediately log in
+ Users can log in / log out
+ Users can use a demo login to try the site
+ Users can't use certain features without logging in

### 2. Fridge inventory functionality
+ Users can add and remove foods from fridge
+ Food items within user's fridge will automatically be saved

### 3. Recipe recommender based on food ingredients
+ Based on select items from the user's fridge, a list of results will dynamically update based on those ingredient parameters

### 4. Saved Recipes
+ Users are able to save recipes (to their 'Saved Recipes') from search results (can add / remove)

## Technologies and Technical Challenges

Digifridge was built using the MERN stack. In addition, we used the Edamam API for recipe selection.
